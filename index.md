# Practice Text Entry 

This is test text for playing around with the markdown syntax. Text can be **Bolded**, _Italicized_, or shown as `code`. Each of these has their own utility, and should be used whenever it seems fitting. (Note: It _**pppears**_ that these can be _`mixed`_, **`matched`**, and _**`Combined`**_ freely!)

_**The Original help text for this has been left as-is, in order to reference off of while maaking later additions to the page.**_

' ToDo: Insert applicable information, format as desired, and delete all helper text below once satisfied with initial results '
1. Decide on structure and desired content of page by referring to other public pages
1. Begin updating page with own personal information and projects 
       1. Links, images, descriptions, etc.
1. Finalize page
       1. Clean up default text 
       1. Test different themes to see how each would work with desired content
       1. Decide on final design, commit as v1 / Initial Page / <date> Update or similar name
